                    <p>When it comes to fitness, working out doesn’t have to mean going out. You don’t need to trek to the gym to get a good workout. You can accomplish plenty without ever leaving the house. Whether you want to build your endurance, increase your strength, burn calories to keep your waistline in check, or do all of the above, you can do it in the comfort of your own home. In fact, the benefits of exercising at home are pretty</p>
                    <h2> It is convenient.</h2>
                    <p> Life is hectic, but working out at home makes it easy to fit fitness into your busy lifestyle. There’s no need to waste time and energy gathering your stuff, packing your gym bag, driving across town, and fighting for a parking space. All you have to do is don suitable clothes, walk to the designated room, and start sweating. Honestly, if your pajamas can double as workout gear, you can even skip getting dressed!</p>
                    <h2> It is flexible and versatile.</h2>
                    <p> What’s more flexible than a master yoga practitioner? Your workout routine when you commit to working out at home. Your fitness options won’t be limited by a gym’s operating hours or class schedule. You can exercise whenever you want. In fact, you can even break your workout up and complete it in shifts if that works best for you. Plus, thanks to the plethora of internet fitness videos available these days, you can take a fitness class whenever you want.</p>
                    <h2> Availability is never an issue.</h2>
                    <p> If you have ever belonged to a gym, you’ve probably wasted time waiting for equipment or settled for another activity because the class you were eager to take was full. One of the major benefits of exercising at home is that you never have to wait for equipment or space, so your workout won’t lose momentum.</p>                </div>
                    <h2> Germs aren’t a concern.</h2>
                    <p> Exercise generally involves sweat, and sweat doesn’t stay between the lines. It drips and spatters, potentially contaminating everything it touches with bacteria and germs. If you want to work out without catching the flu or coming down with a cold, the gym isn’t the best place to accomplish your fitness goals. While sweat will still be a factor when you work out at home, you will only need to worry about your sweat (or perhaps your partner’s sweat). This makes it far more sanitary and less likely to gross you out.</p>
                    <h2> You can enjoy privacy.</h2>
                    <p> Every gym seems to have fitness buffs who thrive on “helping” their fellow exercisers. Whether it’s the woman who always picks the treadmill beside you and chatters while you try to get into the zone, the would-be romancer who wants to offer hands-on pointers about your form in the weight room, or the eternally fashionable beauty who seems to thrive on calling attention to her superior gear, these people are distracting and annoying. They’re difficult to dodge at the gym, but they will never cross your path if you exercise at home.</p>
                    <h2> The environment will always be comfortable.</h2>
                    <p> In your home, you can do it your way. You select the music, the décor, the temperature, and the activities. Stock the fridge with your preferred post-workout snacks, and turn the TV to your favorite channel. Plus, you can easily close the door to block out distractions like wandering pets and pestering children.</p>
                    <h2> You can focus on your fitness.</h2> 
                    <p> When you exercise at home, the pressure is off. There is no fear of judgment, and you won’t have to worry about someone laughing at your missteps. You can wear what you want, try the exercises that interest you without worrying about looking silly, and make whatever faces or sounds help you get the job done. By eliminating the distractions of the gym, you can focus on your fitness and stay in the zone.</p>
                    <h2>It is budget-friendly.</h2>   
                    <p> Saving money is one of the best benefits of exercising at home. You will save cash because there’s no membership fee, no need to shell out for parking or gas, and no pressure to have stylish workout clothes. Yes, you will need to buy equipment, but it doesn’t take much to furnish a basic home gym. Start simple, and add additional fitness gear as you feel the urge.</p>
                    <h2> It will exercise your brain.</h2>   
                    <p> When you decide to get fit at home, you take responsibility for your own health and safety. It’s up to you to consider your own physical limitations, learn the finer points of good form, and really explore the exercises that intrigue you. In doing so, you will exercise more than your body; learning about fitness gives your brain a welcome workout as well.</p>
                    <h2> It limits your excuses.</h2> 
                    <p>Many a would-be exerciser has fallen into the trap of making excuses. Committing to working out at home limits those excuses. It’s never too cold or snowy outside to exercise at home. When time is tight, it’s easy to fit in a few minutes here and there, since all you have to do is walk across the hall. There are no worries about who’s watching, what you’re wearing, whether a class is full, or which pieces of equipment are available. When you exercise at home, you are in control.</p>    
                    <h2>Start your home exercise program today!</h2>
                    <p> Working out from home has numerous benefits. However, simply deciding to exercise from home is not enough. You need to be motivated and consistent so you can see actual results. Speaking of results, make sure to keep track of your fitness journey. You can always get a diary and note any changes there. Alternatively, you can check out the EROS Smart Scale, which records up to 13 fitness metrics and stores all its findings in a handy app you can access at all times. Whatever you choose, remember that the outcome is up to you!</p>
